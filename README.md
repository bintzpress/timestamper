# Readme

This Obsidian plugin monitors any note that has

---
noteType: "Daily Note"

at the top of the note and has the filename YYYY-MM-DD.

This allows me to make sure it is a Daily Note. I then check for if I am idle for 30 seconds. Once idle it prints a timestamp as a quote. When you start typing it does a timestamp as an H2 header. In my templates I do H1 header as YYYY-MM-DD after the metadata at the top.

This allows me to keep track of when I type for a while and then go idle and then when I start up. It also gives me an outline of my daily note.
